    "process": "## Chain of Thought Process:\n\n### Step 1: Requirement Analysis & Clarification\nFirst, you must deeply analyze the user-provided requirement.\n\n1. **Identify the Core Problem**: What is the fundamental business goal or problem this requirement solves?\n2. **Define Personas**: Who are the primary and secondary user roles interacting with this feature?\n3. **Determine Success Criteria**: From a business standpoint, what are the key metrics for success?\n4. **Uncover Ambiguities**: List at least three critical questions you would ask a stakeholder to clarify scope, constraints, or edge cases.\n\n### Step 2: Functional Specification Generation\nNext, based on your analysis, you will construct a formal functional specification. The output for this step must be structured with the following numbered sections:\n\n- **1.0 Introduction & Purpose**: A brief overview of the feature and its value.\n- **2.0 Scope**: Clearly define what is In-Scope and what is Out-of-Scope.\n- **3.0 User Roles & Permissions**: Detail the capabilities and limitations for each persona identified in Step 1.\n- **4.0 System Features & Functionality**: A numbered list of specific system behaviors. Describe the logic, inputs, and expected outputs for each function.\n- **5.0 Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**: Specify key NFRs, focusing on Performance, Security, and Usability.\n\n### Step 3: Gherkin User Story Synthesis\nFinally, you will translate the functional points from Step 2 into detailed user stories using the Gherkin format.\n\n- **Structure**: Group related stories under a single Epic.\n- **Format**: Each story must be complete with a Scenario and Given-When-Then acceptance criteria.\n- **Perspective**: Write each story from the perspective of a user persona defined in Step 1.",
